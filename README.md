The following is a job as a Sports Performance Analyst, Premier Data is a sports analysis company that specializes in providing coaches and players at suburban football with statistics, edits and highlights from their games. The main duties of this role are: coding Australian Rules football games, assisting in producing reports and analysing match statistics, assisting in producing highlight videos and also coding other seasonal sports as required.

This job is appealing to me because I’ve always had a great interest in statistics in sport as well as analyzing those statistics to find useful information to benefit the team.
I have worked in sports statistics before as a junior analyst at the St. Bernards Football Club for several years, to obtain this job I will have to study a Bachelor of Communication degree then I will have to undertake as many classes as I can in statistics, probability and computer sciences so that I can build a solid foundation of education that is necessary in being a sports analyst.


### Learning Styles

The results of these tests mean that I’m a visual learner that is interested in security and peaceful living, I’m extremely thorough, responsible and dependable. I believe that the traits I possess would help in a team environment because being thorough and understanding of others are very important team-based traits. I should consider this when forming a team to try and find like-minded individuals so that we can all work efficiently together.

### Overview of Project Idea

My project will be based on how we can use augmented reality in the workplace to help train new employees while also not requiring human instructions, this will make training simplified and easy to understand/learn. 

### Motivation

Augmented Reality (AR) is quickly becoming an alternative technology for training programs because AR allows the user to see the real world, with virtual objects combined with the real world. Working in a hospital as an orderly has caused me to wonder if AR could be used to train new employees because training can be difficult and hard to understand at times. It can also take a lot of time away from your day if you are required to train someone which then, in turn, makes you work even harder for the rest of the day. I feel as though AR could eliminate a lot of these problems we encounter because it would take away the human element and provide a learning tool that can be understood in a variety of languages.

### Description

This AR product will help to improve people management within the workplace, regular staff will not be required to train any new employees as the AR devices will provide all essential training.
 AR improves on traditional learning by combining digital information with the real world. AR training allows users to learn and practice skills in realistic settings. 
The healthcare system has a diverse range of waste that needs to be carefully managed, there are 9 clear types of medical waste. Through the AR we will be able to train staff to distinguish between the types of waste and how it’s collected and disposed of. Staff are trained on a weekly basis at present to identify and categorise the 9 different types of waste. The AR will describe the waste to the user as well as where its located within the hospital wards and how and where to dispose of it correctly. 
The medical waste is colour coded into 9 separate colours, the AR will be set up to train in all of these 9 colour coded categories. For instance, when training in a hospital the trainee is required to learn the types of medical waste used. Some hospital’s only collect 3 types of medical waste, Cytotoxic (Purple), Highly Infectious (Yellow) and Infectious (Orange), larger Hospital’s collect and manage the full 9 types of waste.   Each Hospital could set their AR learning to fit their specific requirements.
Given that there is a large percentage of staff with English as a second language working every day in the Healthcare/Hospitals, the AR training could be set up to allow the staff member to choose their native language for efficient learning. By setting the AR to be used in a range of different languages along with the visual of learning the colour system of medical waste the employee’s training is completed effectively for waste management. 
The AR headset would be placed in the hospital learning centre so that new staff and even students can learn as required and in the moment through self-learning. This AR technology has the capacity to train/re-skill staff or students from the basic healthcare management right through to difficult and precise medical procedures i.e. in surgical theatres and outpatients treatments. 

### Tools & Technologies

The software that’s required to build and code the augmented reality is ‘LUMOplay’, LUMOplay is $599 for the pro edition which will allow the developer to create and preview custom interactive training-based games. This software is compatible with Orbbec, Kinect for Xbox One, touchscreens and USB web cameras. We will be using the Orbbec Astra Pro (valued at $149) as a 3D camera to project our interactive training to the employee. The Orbbec will be used just to keep the costs at a minimum initially as a test.

### Skills Required

A software developer with vast knowledge of coding languages such as C#, C++, JavaScript and python will be required for this project as these languages are the most versatile and most used languages when it comes to coding in Augmented Reality. It’s quite feasible, the costs of the software and hardware are under $1000 collectively with the added cost of the developer this idea could be delivered under $5k and potentially within is short time frame i.e. within a month or two. 

### Outcome

If this project is successful, the outcome will be self-learning in real time whilst also no longer requiring classroom learning and this technology will reduce the ongoing training costs of the hospitals. It would also potentially reduce the risk of cross contamination and misuse of medical waste, it’s also a straight-forward way to complete compliance training.
